## What is CiteMET?

**CiteMET** (Cited, Memorable, Effective, Trackable) is a method to increase your AI/LLM traffic by creating share buttons that help users share your content with AI engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and more. This helps your content get cited in AI responses and builds your brand's presence in AI memory.

## Generated Markdown Example

The app generates markdown code like this:

```markdown
> Summarize and analyze this article with üëâ <a href="https://chat.openai.com/?q=..." target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="send-ga-event ai-share-click-chatgpt-data-governance">üí¨ ChatGPT </a> or <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/search/new?q=..." target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="send-ga-event ai-share-click-perplexity-data-governance">üîç Perplexity </a> or <a href="https://claude.ai/new?q=..." target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="send-ga-event ai-share-click-claude-data-governance">ü§ñ Claude </a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/search?udm=50&aep=11&q=..." target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="send-ga-event ai-share-click-google-aim-data-governance">üîÆ Google AI Mode </a> or <a href="https://x.com/i/grok?text=..." target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="send-ga-event ai-share-click-grok-data-governance">üê¶ Grok (X) </a>.
```

## GA4 Analytics Tracking

The generated links include built-in Google Analytics 4 event tracking:

### CSS Classes
Each link includes a combined CSS class: `send-ga-event ai-share-click-{platform}-{topic}`

**Examples:**
- `send-ga-event ai-share-click-chatgpt-data-governance`
- `send-ga-event ai-share-click-perplexity-marketing`
- `send-ga-event ai-share-click-claude-general`

### Setup GA4 Event Tracking
1. Add JavaScript to your site to listen for clicks on these classes
2. Set up custom events in GA4 to track button performance

### Analytics Benefits
Track in GA4:
- Which AI platforms get the most clicks
- Which topics perform best  
- Click-through rates by platform and topic
- User engagement with AI share buttons

## Supported AI Platforms

| Platform | URL Format | Purpose | GA4 Class Name |
|----------|------------|---------|----------------|
| **ChatGPT** | `https://chat.openai.com/?q=` | General AI conversations | `chatgpt` |
